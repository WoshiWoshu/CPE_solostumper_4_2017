• Your repository must contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files
(binary, temp files, obj files,...).
• Error messages have to be written on the error output, and the program should
then exit with the 84 error code (0 if there is no error).

For this project, the only authorized function is write.

Write a program that takes two strings and displays 1\n if the first string is hidden in the second string.
Otherwise, it displays 0\n.
A string is hidden in the second, if each character from the first string can be found in the second one in the
same order as in the first string.
